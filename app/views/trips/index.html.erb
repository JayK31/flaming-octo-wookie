<!-- Matching the current_user id with the trip user id in order to show the current user's trips -->
<!-- <#% @trips.each do |trip| %>   -->
    <!-- <#%= link_to(trip.start + ' to ' + trip.destination, trip_path(trip)) %><strong> (*Group Leader)</strong><br/> -->
<!-- <#% end %> -->


<!-- needs refactoring
-idea is to find the invites that include the current user name, and find the trip that the current user is on
-will redirect them to the trip, but will not have group leader priviledges
-need to figure out how to get all invitations with the user_id (check trips_controller#index)
 -->

<!-- used find.where(args).all to collect all invites with matchinged user_id,
  then iterated through each @invite object to find match
  -ugly but it works -->
<% @invite.each do |invite| %>
  <% if invite.user_id == current_user.id %>
    <%= link_to(invite.trip.start + ' to ' + invite.trip.destination, trip_path(invite.trip)) %><br/>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
