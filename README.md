#Project One: TripCollaborator v0.1.0
##Under construction

Trips are fun. Forgetting stuff you need for the trip is not fun. Have a friend who always forgets to bring what he/she said he/she would? Well now he/she won't have any excuses. With TripCollaborator you'll be able to create trips and invite others. You'll be able to join trips. And you'll be able to create an item checklist that will allow people to claim items. This way, when Billy forgets to bring the water purifier on your backpacking trip, he won't be able to say, "Hey, if we had a list to reference, I wouldn't have forgotten it!"

###Future Features
* Invite users who have not yet registered for TC
* Notify user by text/email about trip details
* Lots more stuff
